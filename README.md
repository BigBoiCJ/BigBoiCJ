ðŸ‘‹ Hi from France ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·

## Infos about me
Obviously, not my main GitHub account.

I do stuff from time to time.

Sometimes, it's good and useful, and sometimes, it sucks.

## Ethical pirating?
I believe in ethical pirating:
- Please, buy the game that you like to support developers and publishers!
- The video game industry exists because people can make a living from it!
- Too pricey for you? Wishlist the game, and wait for a sale! 
- Don't like DRMs? Buy the game, and get a non-DRM version on GOG!
